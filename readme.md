# Arid Central Asian brGDGT 

## Project description
This GitHub project is associated to the submission of *BrGDGT-based paleothermometer in drylands: the necessity to constrain aridity and salinity as confounding factors to ensure the robustness of calibrations.* in *Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta*

This R script is the full script develloped in the publication.
It is usefull to verify the replicability of this study.
The script could be modified for calibrations in other study areas. 

## How to install/run the ACADB brGDGT calibrations?
1. Install [R](https://larmarange.github.io/analyse-R/installation-de-R-et-RStudio.html)
2. It is easier to use [Rstudio](https://posit.co/downloads/)
3. Download this GitHub repository from ZIP file (by clicing on the green button `<> Code` beyond. 
## To run the full code
1. Many `R` package are necessary to run this script. Check if all required package are already installed in case of error appearing during the script process.
2. Open the `GDGT_ACADB.Rproj` file in Rstudio
3. In the section `#### Select figures / tables to plot ####` change the boolean value to `TRUE` or `FALSE` to plot the selected figure or table
